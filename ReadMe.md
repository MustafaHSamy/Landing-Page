<br>

## what's-in-the-page
- A navigation bar that adds a navigation link to itself for each section in the page
<br> and uses the section's h2 as its inner text.
- When a section is in view port it and its link in navigation bar are highlited
- When the user clicks on the page, the navigation bar is shown or hidden
- the navigation bar is hidden when the user scrolls down and is shown when scrolls up
- when the user goes deeper in the page, a button that navigates to the very top of the page is shown,<br>
and it is hidden whe the user goes back up
- if a section is clicked, it and its navigation link gets higlighted
- when the screen width is less than 600px, the navigation links are hidden and wrapped inside <br>
a collapsiable menu that is shown whe a button in the navigation bar is clicked and is hidden if<br>
the user clicks anywhere or chooses a specific section to navigate to
- when the screen width is less than 600px, the button that navigates to top is moved to the navigation<br>
bar so it is not to hide any content in narrow screens
